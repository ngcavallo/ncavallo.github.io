            <p>Hi! I'm Natalie. I was born on December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2003 in Chicago, IL. I live with my mom, dad, older sister Allison and younger brother Nick.
        
            <p>My name means Christmas baby, and my parents decide to name me that because my mom was still in the hospital on Christmas. I like to say I was born on Christmas-Eve-Eve.
            
            <p>My family comes from all over. I'm half-white (German and Spanish), a quarter Ecuadorian, and a quarter Pakistani.

        I've always wanted to do something with space. It has fascinated me since I could read and understand what space is and how much of a mystery it is. I watch a ton of shows about planets and the chemistry and physics that go along with it. It's so cool to think about stars than are billions of times bigger than our sun, which is already about 1.3 million times bigger than Earth. I really, <em>really</em> want to be an astrophysicist at

               target= "_blank" 
               title= "nasa.gov">NASA</a> and explore space with science. It's so cool!!!! 
            <!--<a> anchors a website to text inside of the ><. Website address is href, target= "_blank" opens it in a new tab, title is the tooltip.-->
            <!--<em> italicizes text inside the caret-->
            
        <p><b>What 3 adjectives would you use to describe yourself? Why?</b>
            <!--Bolds text inside <b></b>-->
        
            <p>I'd say that I'm creative, ambitious, and musical. 
            <ul>I'm creative because I love painting, drawing, and doing anything artistic. 
            <br>I'm ambitious because I have a lot of big dreams that I am working towards (rather slowly, but still) and I am really interested in a lot of things. 
            <br>I am musical because I love playing the guitar and listening to music all the time. 
            </ul>
        <br>
        
        <p><b>What is/are your favorite subject(s) in school? Why?</b>
        
            <p>My favorite subjects are Drawing & Painting and Geometry. 
            <ul>
                I love art and last year Mr. Gorsich was an amazing teacher and he helped me improve so much. I am pretty good at painting and drawing because he taught us how to and then let us experiment. He's an incredible teacher.
                <br>
                <br>
                I really love Geometry becaue Ms. Au is by far the best math teacher I've ever had and probably the best I ever will. She teaches stuff that's actually useful on more than just algebra or just geometry. I learned so much last year and I'm learning even more this year.
                <br>
                <br>Computer Science isn't my favorite subject, but I do enjoy the challenge. I also like improving my typing. Also, Mr. Heo is a really funny and genuine teacher. He helps me understand the code really easily and I actually have a lot of fun seeing all the pieces of code fit together to make a website.
            </ul>
    
        <p><b>What activities/hobbies do you participate in outside of school?</b>
        
            <p>I love to paint, play guitar, and play volleyball.
            
        <p><b>What is a physical goal you have for yourself this year? How will you attempt to achieve these goals?</b>
        
            <p>I want to have more endurance and have stronger abs. I'm going to try out for the short season at the Chicago Elite Volleyball Club and to do that I need to practice more and get in shape. I'm going to do a month-long fitness workout at home and go to the gym on the weekends hopefully.
        
        <p><b>What is an emotional goal you have for yourself this year? How will you attempt to achieve these goals?</b>
        
            <p>I want to be more confident and become a more honest person. I'm going to tell the truth more often and believe in myself more? I'm not exactly sure how to do this.
            
        <p><b>What is a social goal you have for yourself this year? How will you attempt to achieve these goals?</b>
    
            </p>I want to become closer with old friends and new friends. I also want to get rid of people that aren't genuine (not literally!) and meet new people. I'm going to this by making plans and talking to people.
